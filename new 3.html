<p>I have been very interested in cars and their mechanics for many years. In the near future I hope to purchase a project specific car that I can build from the ground-up.
I enjoy building cars because you can put your own personality into it, that is different from all others. I also enjoy doing my own work because it gives me pride
knowing that I didn't have to take my car to a shop. The term "Japanese domestic market" refers to Japan's home market for vehicles. 
For the importer, these terms refer to vehicles and parts designed to conform to Japanese regulations and to suit Japanese buyers.</p>
