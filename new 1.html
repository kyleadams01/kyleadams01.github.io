<p>I began diving at the beginning of my high school career. I was a gymnast before high school, but the lengthly travel to the gym everyday 
set me on the path to find something new. The closest thing to the sport I had once loved turned out to be springboard diving. The skills in each 
sport are closely related which made the transition easier than expected. After four years of high school diving, I decided to continue once I began
college at Umaine.   </p>
